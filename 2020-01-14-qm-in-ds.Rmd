Data science has survived the initial period of hyped pioneer development. It is now time for consolidation where people start to think about what methods and what techniques are most useful in the field of data science. One important part of this process is the developement of guide lines and procedures related to quality management and quality assurance. This requires a clear understanding of what it really means when people do data science. 

A good and useful representation of a data science process is can be found in the book [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/). Section 1.1 of the just cited book contains the following diagram on the process of data science. 

```{r ds-meaning-r4ds, echo=FALSE, hook_convert_odg=TRUE, fig_path="odg"}
#rmdhelp::use_odg_graphic(ps_path = "odg/ds-meaning-r4ds.odg")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "odg/ds-meaning-r4ds.png")
```
 
The above diagram is extended to get a better idea of what the used representation means when it comes to quality management in data science. The extension consists of the 


are simply the replacement of the term `Program` by the more specific term `Software Engineering`.
